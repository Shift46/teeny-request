# Changelog

## [4.0.0](https://www.github.com/googleapis/teeny-request/compare/v3.11.3...v4.0.0) (2019-07-15)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* **deps:** Node 6 is no longer supported.
* Previously, error messages were parsed from the response body in streaming mode, and emitted to the user. This did not match callback behavior or the `request` module's behavior. Errors will now have to be parsed from the response body.

### Bug Fixes
